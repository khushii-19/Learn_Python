# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?

s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}

# This is NOT allowed
# sets in Python can only contain immutable (unchangeable) items.
# But a list ([1, 2]) is mutable, meaning you can change its contents â€” and therefore it cannot be added to a set.
