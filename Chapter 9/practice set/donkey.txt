The ##### stood proudly on the hill,
 munching on a carrot like it owned the world. 
 Every morning, the farmer’s ##### would bray loudly, waking up the entire village. 
 “That’s just Don the #####,” they'd say with a smile. One day, 
 the ##### decided it was tired of carrying sacks and went on a mini adventure.
  Along the way, it met another ##### who wore sunglasses and claimed to be a rockstar. 
  Together, the two #####s formed a band and performed for cows, chickens, and other curious animals. 
  It was truly the day of the #####s.



The farmer was angry because the ###### ran away from the field.

Never act like a ###### when you're in a serious discussion.

She laughed out loud when he compared himself to a ######.

The ###### was stubborn and refused to move an inch.

I can't believe he just called me a ######!

In the story, the prince rides a ###### instead of a horse.

That guy behaves like a total ###### in group projects.

The villagers tied the load to the ###### and headed to the market.

A ###### in a suit is still a ######.

The old ###### brayed loudly all night.
